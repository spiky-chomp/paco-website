            Despite the fact that parrots are typically linked with tropical habitats, they are not all tropical birds;
            there are over 398 kinds! Although most of them live in tropical areas, these birds can adapt to a variety
            of environments quite quickly; in fact,
            some of them have even adapted to the cold weather in Europe. Their ability to adapt to new environments is
            related to their intelligence; parrots are as
            intelligent as a five-year-old human, and they can communicate with one another and even identify each other
            in relatively similar way that we do with our faces
            and names. Parrots' long lifespan, which can last up to 80 years, also allows them to be very experienced
            and communicate that to the younger ones.

        <p>
            Macaws are the world's largest and most colourful parrot species; the Hyacinth Macaw is the world's largest
            parrot, at one metre in length,
            and the scarlet macaw is one of the most colourful parrot species.

        <p>
            The large crests and curved bills distinguish cockatoos. Their plumage is often less colourful than that of
            other parrots, consisting primarily of
            white, grey, or black with contrasting colours in the crest, cheeks, and tail.
