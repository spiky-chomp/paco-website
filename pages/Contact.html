                    I'm a high school student who started learning coding about a month ago
                    (as of January 21st, 2022); I was born in Colombia and grew up there until I moved to 
                    Canada in 2015; since then, I've been in school and im currently in my last year of 
                    high school.

                Greetings, Ms. Edwards! Please don't give me a S. All of this new coding stuff 
                has been a little confusing, but I'm giving it my all; this website is far from
                 complete, but I've come a long way since I first started learning; I'll keep updating 
                 it because it's not just for school.
            </p>
